# Collecting_Data-Assignment_4
Documentation should include at least a brief description of:

    The corpus itself.
    Your target audience and the intended use of the corpus.
    Text selection criteria.
    The data collection process.
    Cleaning and/or preprocessing steps if you’ve done any.
    Annotations that you’ve added and tools that you used for that.
    The format of the files in the corpus (in this case, probably txt and csv), as well as the description of the columns in the CSV file.
    The quality checks, if you’ve done any.
    Anything else that you think is important to mention.
